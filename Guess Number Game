## Program picks a random number between 1-20. User has 7 guesses to guess the number.

import random
secretnumber = random.randint(1,20)
print('I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.')

for guessesTaken in range (1,7):
    guess = int(input('Take a guess: '))

    if guess < secretnumber:
        print('Your guess is too low.')
    elif guess > secretnumber:
        print('Your guess is too high')
    else:
        break

if guess == secretnumber:
    print('Congratulations, you guessed correctly in ' + str(guessesTaken) + ' guesses.')
else:
    print('Nope. The number I was thinking of was ' + str(secretnumber) + '.')
